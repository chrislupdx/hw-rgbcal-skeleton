does the knob have an interrupt handler?
saadc functions hat seem relevant:
- interrupt handler
- tap the config struct?
- have we configed the saadc channel correctly?
- how many channels do we need to throw im there?
- THERE IS A DIFFERENTIAL FUNCITON IS THAT THE DIFF? <its an impl on channelconfig, not relevant>
- we have this whole callbackresult think, are we not handling the async for knob correct (see keep sampling nad calling hte callback)
- saadc has a run_task_sampler which might be relevant to our hting

Diffrence bwetewen:
1. run_sampler. 
2. rin_task_sampler
3. sample

knob//saadc/main are wired together, 
1. at what point in the software do we actually assert a pin for the knob
2.

- i think its about picking whicch saadc function and spinning up the right depdendencies. i still think one of the continues samplers /feels/ right bc the crashes we are seeing seem to indicatate some form of an early-shutdown related failure.

board.saadc is invoked in the new on main ln 63

1. what kind of async patterns is the core program using and is there an saadc fucntion for the knob that is better
2. in the sample code are there patterns you see worth pulling from/worth contrasing

- wtf is. self.state.levels[2] in ui's run function
- are we using rgb.rs at all usefully or is it just being employed by boiler

curr ideas
1. change in knob.rs the function from sample to something more sophisticated and continus
2.  https://crates.io/crates/rotary-encoder-embedded as opposed to saadc,  using a Timer between 850-1000Hz seems to work best.


i think run_timer_sampler might be the winner for now with a 850-1000Hz timer, we are using a resolution of i think 14mhz lets check 

ok so the real question is do we replace the saadc code :re rotary encoders with a new library altogether
