TODO
- Share the frame rate value between the Ui and the Rgb structs.
- Adjust Rgb delays according to the frame rate.
- Add support for the Red and Green LED lines.
- Use the buttons in the Ui.

is ui.run() ever used

what does the joi futures actually return

i think e00002c0 is an address, maybe the knob
quesitons
1. whats the saadc block, how is it being used, 
2. what do we read out
3. where is frame rate being written and defined
does embassy have features for handling and catching changes in 
4. saadc things we should care about?
5. oh interrupts were yiouyr old pattern, is this still relevant to futures or is that just a different paradigm to manager concurrency ( i think i tis )
